## Sinatra Homework - Rock Paper Scissors

Create a simple sinatra app to allow the user to play rock, paper, scissors in their browser.

You might be able to go to /rock/scissors and return "rock wins" to the page, for example.

### Extensions:

Create a `models` directory for your game logic class e.g. 'Game' and put all of the logic in there.

Add a welcome page (and a route to get it) to explain the rules before the user picks their move.

They will enter their chosen move in the address bar, the computer will randomly pick a move to play against them.
The player will see the result of the game in the rendered HTML.

Adapt your site to play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock! (see: http://www.samkass.com/theories/RPSSL.html )
